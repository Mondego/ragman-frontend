# RAGMan frontend

## About

RAGMan frontend is a fork of [ChatBot-UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) at around Nov 8, 2023, which is further developed by the Mondego group at UC Irvine. Our project is a true fork, in the sense that it does not follow ChatBot-UI any longer. Our UI aims to be feature poor and very simple. Unlike the original ChatBot-UI, RAGMan frontend requires a second web app, RAGMan-backend, to work. All the fancy intelligent actions are done in RAGMan-backend.

## Running Locally

NOTE: requires NodeJS version 18 or above.

**1. Clone Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mondego/ragman-frontend.git
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm i
```

**3. Provide OpenAI API Key**

Create a .env.local file in the root of the repo with your OpenAI API Key: (This step is unnecessary, because we call openai API from backend, but you can set the key to make sure the frontend is running)

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

> You can set `OPENAI_API_HOST` where access to the official OpenAI host is restricted or unavailable, allowing users to configure an alternative host for their specific needs.

> Additionally, if you have multiple OpenAI Organizations, you can set `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` to specify one.

**4. Run App**
* run locally
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

* use this command for server running
    ```bash
    npm run dev -- -p 3333
    ```


**5. Use It**

You should be able to start chatting.

If you do not provide an OpenAI API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, users will have to provide their own key.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
